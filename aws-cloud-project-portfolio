# AWS Cloud Portfolio Project

> **A comprehensive full-stack web application demonstrating proficiency across multiple AWS services**

This project showcases hands-on experience with AWS cloud infrastructure by building a scalable, secure, and monitored web application using industry best practices and modern cloud architecture patterns.

## üéØ Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a personal portfolio website with dynamic blog functionality that demonstrates practical knowledge of core AWS services and cloud architecture principles.

**Architecture Philosophy:** Serverless-first approach with emphasis on security, scalability, and cost optimization while maintaining high availability and performance.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The application follows a multi-tier architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Presentation Layer:** Static assets served via CloudFront and S3
- **Application Layer:** RESTful APIs hosted on EC2 with auto-scaling capabilities  
- **Data Layer:** Managed database services with automated backups
- **Security Layer:** IAM roles, security groups, and encryption at rest/transit
- **Monitoring Layer:** Comprehensive logging and alerting infrastructure

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

| Layer | AWS Service | Purpose | Implementation Status |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| **Content Delivery** | CloudFront + S3 | Global content distribution and static hosting | üîÑ In Progress |
| **Compute** | EC2 + Auto Scaling | Scalable web server infrastructure | ‚è≥ Planned |
| **Database** | RDS (MySQL) | Persistent data storage with automated backups | ‚è≥ Planned |
| **Security** | IAM + VPC | Identity management and network isolation | ‚è≥ Planned |
| **Monitoring** | CloudWatch + X-Ray | Application performance monitoring and tracing | ‚è≥ Planned |
| **Automation** | Lambda + EventBridge | Event-driven serverless functions | ‚è≥ Planned |

## üìã Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Static Web Infrastructure
**Current Focus:** S3 static website hosting with CloudFront distribution

**Key Features:**
- Responsive web design with modern UI/UX
- Optimized asset delivery through CDN
- SSL/TLS encryption for secure connections
- Custom domain configuration

### Phase 2: Dynamic Backend Services
**Objective:** EC2-based API server with load balancing

**Planned Features:**
- RESTful API endpoints for content management
- Session management and user authentication
- Horizontal scaling with Application Load Balancer
- Blue-green deployment strategy

### Phase 3: Database Integration
**Objective:** Persistent data layer with high availability

**Planned Features:**
- Multi-AZ RDS deployment for fault tolerance
- Automated backup and point-in-time recovery
- Read replicas for improved read performance
- Database connection pooling and optimization

### Phase 4: Security Hardening
**Objective:** Enterprise-grade security implementation

**Planned Features:**
- Least privilege IAM policies and roles
- VPC with private subnets for database tier
- Security groups with restrictive inbound rules
- AWS WAF for application-layer protection

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Automation
**Objective:** Operational excellence and automated incident response

**Planned Features:**
- Custom CloudWatch metrics and dashboards
- Automated alerting for system anomalies
- Lambda-based automated remediation
- Cost optimization through resource scheduling

## üèõÔ∏è Infrastructure as Code

All AWS resources are defined and managed through:
- **CloudFormation templates** for reproducible infrastructure
- **Parameterized stacks** for environment-specific deployments
- **Version-controlled configurations** for change tracking
- **Automated rollback capabilities** for failed deployments

## üìä Performance & Scalability

**Design Targets:**
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Response Time:** < 200ms average API response
- **Throughput:** Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- **Scalability:** Auto-scaling based on CPU and memory metrics

**Cost Optimization:**
- Designed to operate within AWS Free Tier limits
- Right-sized instances based on actual usage patterns
- Automated resource scheduling for non-production environments
- Regular cost analysis and optimization reviews

## üîí Security Implementation

**Security Controls:**
- **Data Encryption:** AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Access Control:** Role-based access with MFA requirements
- **Network Security:** VPC isolation with NACLs and security groups
- **Audit Logging:** CloudTrail integration for compliance tracking

**Compliance Considerations:**
- Following AWS Well-Architected Framework principles
- Implementation of security best practices from AWS Security Pillar
- Regular security assessments and vulnerability scanning

## üìà Monitoring & Observability

**Operational Metrics:**
- Application performance monitoring with custom metrics
- Distributed tracing for request flow analysis
- Log aggregation and centralized monitoring
- Automated alerting for service degradation

**Business Metrics:**
- User engagement analytics
- Content performance tracking
- Resource utilization optimization
- Cost per transaction analysis

## üöÄ Deployment Pipeline

**CI/CD Workflow:**
1. **Code Commit:** Automated testing triggers
2. **Build Process:** Artifact creation and validation
3. **Security Scanning:** Static analysis and vulnerability assessment
4. **Deployment:** Staged rollout with automated rollback
5. **Monitoring:** Post-deployment health checks
