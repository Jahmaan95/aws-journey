## 09-06-2025 - Day 1: Project Foundation & S3 Static Website

**What I accomplished today:**
- Set up GitHub repository structure for professional documentation
- Created HTML/CSS website files (index.html, styles.css)
- Learned about Amazon S3 and static website hosting capabilities
- Successfully created AWS account and navigated the console for the first time

**Technical implementation:**
- Designed responsive website with modern CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Implemented mobile-first design approach
- Created professional color scheme and typography
- Structured content to showcase AWS learning progression

**S3 Configuration Process:**
- Created S3 bucket with globally unique name
- Configured static website hosting with index.html as entry point
- Set up bucket policy for public read access (learned JSON policy syntax)
- Uploaded website files and verified accessibility

**The 404 debugging experience:**
- Initially got "NoSuchKey: index.html" error
- Discovered file upload location matters (root vs subfolders)
- Learned difference between S3 object URLs and website endpoints
- Successfully resolved by ensuring files were in bucket root

**Key learning moments:**
- AWS Console navigation is intimidating at first but logical once you understand the structure
- Bucket names must be globally unique across ALL AWS accounts (not just yours)
- S3 static hosting is incredibly fast and reliable
- Public access configuration requires careful balance of security and functionality

**Challenges overcome:**
- Understanding S3 bucket policies (JSON syntax was new to me)
- Configuring public access without compromising security
- File organization and upload location troubleshooting

**Time invested:** 4 hours total
- 1 hour: GitHub setup and documentation
- 2 hours: HTML/CSS development 
- 1 hour: S3 configuration and troubleshooting

**Confidence level:** Excited and surprised by how quickly S3 website worked once configured properly

## Day 2: üöÄ PHASE 2 COMPLETE: EC2 Backend Server Deployed

**Major milestone achieved:**
Successfully deployed a Node.js API server on Amazon EC2 that's accessible from anywhere on the internet!

**What I built:**
- EC2 t2.micro instance running Amazon Linux
- Node.js 18.20.8 runtime environment
- Express.js API server with CORS enabled
- Three functional API endpoints:
  - `/api/health` - Server status and uptime monitoring
  - `/api/info` - Server information and environment details
  - `/api/contact` - Contact form submission handler

**Technical journey - EC2 setup:**
- Launched first EC2 instance using AWS Console
- Learned about instance types (t2.micro for free tier)
- Created and downloaded SSH key pair for secure access
- Used browser-based terminal instead of local SSH (easier for learning)

**Linux server administration learned:**
- Basic command navigation: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`
- File operations: `cat`, `nano` for editing
- Process management: `ps aux` to check running processes
- Package management: `yum update`, `yum install`
- Understanding user permissions and `sudo`

**Node.js development process:**
- Installed Node.js 18.x using official repository setup
- Created project structure with `npm init -y`
- Learned about package.json and dependency management
- Installed Express.js and CORS middleware
- Wrote server code from scratch using JavaScript

**AWS Security Groups configuration:**
- Understood AWS firewall concept (Security Groups)
- Added custom TCP rule for port 3000
- Learned about inbound vs outbound rules
- Configured public access for API endpoints while maintaining SSH security

**Debugging and troubleshooting experience:**
- Server initially wouldn't start due to missing package.json
- Learned to diagnose issues using `ps aux | grep node`
- Used `curl localhost:3000` for local testing before internet access
- Rebuilt project directory when files went missing
- Systematic approach: local testing first, then internet accessibility

**API endpoints working:**
- Health check returns JSON with server status, timestamp, and uptime
- Server info endpoint provides technical environment details
- Contact form handler ready for frontend integration
- All endpoints tested and responding correctly from the internet

**Screenshots of work done**
- Working website

**Key concepts mastered:**
- **Virtual servers in the cloud:** EC2 instances are like renting computers in Amazon's data centers
- **SSH and remote access:** Secure shell connections for server management
- **Linux basics:** Command line navigation and file system understanding
- **API development:** RESTful endpoints that respond to HTTP requests
- **Network security:** Firewall rules and port management
- **Process management:** Running services and keeping them alive

**Real-world skills gained:**
- Cloud server deployment and management
- Backend API development with Node.js
- Network security configuration
- Linux system administration basics
- Troubleshooting server connectivity issues

**Mistakes made and lessons learned:**
- Initially tried HTTPS instead of HTTP (SSL certificates needed for HTTPS)
- Forgot that browser-based terminals use right-click for pasting
- Had to recreate project files when npm commands didn't work properly
- Learned importance of verifying each step before moving to next

**Current architecture:**
```
Internet Users ‚Üí S3 Static Website (Frontend)
Internet Users ‚Üí EC2 API Server (Backend) ‚Üê LIVE AND WORKING!
```

**Time invested today:** 6 hours
- 2 hours: EC2 setup and initial connection
- 2 hours: Linux learning and Node.js installation
- 1.5 hours: Server code development and deployment
- 0.5 hours: Security group configuration and testing

**Technical validation:**
- API accessible at: http://44.202.148.167:3000/api/health
- Server responds with proper JSON formatting
- CORS configured for cross-origin requests
- Express.js middleware working correctly
